         *
         * Keep in mind that the SDK's UVC driver (what OpenCvWebcam uses under the hood) only
         * supports streaming from the webcam in the uncompressed YUV image format. This means
         * that the maximum resolution you can stream at and still get up to 30FPS is 480p (640x480).
         * Streaming at 720p will limit you to up to 10FPS. However, streaming at frame rates other
         * than 30FPS is not currently supported, although this will likely be addressed in a future
         * release. TLDR: You can't stream in greater than 480p from a webcam at the moment.
         *
         * Also, we specify the rotation that the webcam is used in. This is so that the image
         * from the camera sensor can be rotated such that it is always displayed with the image upright.
         * For a front facing camera, rotation is defined assuming the user is looking at the screen.
         * For a rear facing camera or a webcam, rotation is defined assuming the camera is facing
         * away from the user.
